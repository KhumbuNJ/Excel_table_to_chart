# Excel_table_to_chart


This is an app where you can you start by filling a form (user information) and then get to upload a xlsx file and it displays the table and a graph representing income and expenses for this example.

Used Streamlit Python module because it makes it very easy to develop web apps with few lines of code.It's good transforming & visualizing Excel files.

Also used pandas for data manupilation as well as the plotly library for creating figures
